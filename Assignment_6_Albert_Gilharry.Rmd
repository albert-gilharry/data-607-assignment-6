## Intro

<div id = "solution">
**For this assignment, we were tasked with creating HTML, XML, and JSON files of 3 or our favourite books on one of our favorite topics.**
**At least one of the books must have more than one author.**
**Each of the different file structures should be loaded into R data frames. This is a primer for further work with these structures in the semseter.**
</div>


## Load Libraries

```{r load-libraries}
library("tidyverse")
library("rvest")
library("XML")
library("methods")
library("jsonlite")
library("stringr")
library("DT")
library ("RCurl")

```

## Load HTML Data & Create Data Frame

<div id  = "solution">
```{r}

# load HTML data into data frame
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albert-gilharry/DATA607-Assignment-5/master/data/books.html"
htmlBooks <- url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes("table") %>%
  html_table()

htmlBooks <- htmlBooks[[1]]
```
</div>

## View HTML Data Frame

<div id = "solution">
```{r}
datatable(htmlBooks, options = list(filter = FALSE), filter = "none")
```
</div>

## Load XML Data & Create Data Frame

<div id = "comment">
The books with multiple authors posed a problem because the built in functionality to convert XML to a data frame 
concatenates the author nodes without a delimiter. For this reason, I looped through the data to format the authors' names properly.
This may not be most efficient way of doing so, but this is a very small data set, so it is fine.
</div>

<div id = "solution">
```{r}

url <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albert-gilharry/DATA607-Assignment-5/master/data/books.xml")
doc <- xmlParse(url)

data <- xpathSApply(doc, "//BOOKS/BOOK/AUTHORS",xmlChildren, simplify = TRUE)
authors = c()
for(i in 1:length(data)){
  c <- c()
  for(j in 1:length(data[[i]])){
   c <-  append( c, xmlValue(data[[i]][[j]]) )
  }
  authors <- append(authors, paste(unlist(c),collapse = ", "))
}

# use the built in function to create the data frame
xmlBooks <- xmlToDataFrame(url,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# fix the authors
xmlBooks$AUTHORS <- authors
```
</div>

## View XML Data Table

<div id = "solution">
```{r}
datatable(xmlBooks, options = list(filter = FALSE),filter="none")
```
</div>

## Load JSON Data & Create Data Frame

<div id = "comment">
The books with multiple authors posed a problem again because the built in functionality to create a data frame from JSON data
attaches an list for the authors. I looped through the data to format the authors.
This may not be the most efficient way of doing so, but this is a very small data set, so it is fine.
</div>

<div id = "solution">
```{r}
# load JSON data into data frame
url <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albert-gilharry/DATA607-Assignment-5/master/data/books.json")
jsonBooks <- fromJSON(url)
authors = c()
jsonBooks <- jsonBooks$books

# create a comma separated list for authors of each book
for(i in 1:nrow(jsonBooks)){
 authors <- append(authors, paste(unlist( jsonBooks$author[i] ),collapse = ", "))
}

# update authors
jsonBooks$author <- authors
```
</div>

## View JSON Data Table

<div id = "solution">
```{r}
datatable(jsonBooks, options = list(filter = FALSE),filter="none")
```
</div>

## Conclusion

<div id = "comment">
In conclusion, R packages make it relatively easy parse and load HTML, XML, and JSON data into data frames.
These data frames were not identical due to how the packeges handle one to many relationships in JSON, and XML.
The processing that I did eventlually led to all data frames being identical.
